## Overview

## Usage

<UsageGuidelines guidelines={["Use it to display text formed from a single sentence, or multiple sentences."]} />

## Variants

### Sizes and weights

Text component comes in two sizes: text1 (16px) and text2 (14px), and in three weights: bold (700), medium (600) and normal (400)

### Colors

Text component comes in four colors: primary, secondary, on-primary and on-inverted

### Overflow

Our Text component supports overflow state.
When the text is longer than its container and the ellipsis flag is on, the end of the text will be truncated and will display "..."

We support two kinds of ellipsis: single-line ellipsis with a tooltip displayed in hover or ellipsis after multiple lines. You can see examples for both use cases below.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={TextStories.Overflow} />
</Canvas>

<Tip>Ellipsis prop is true by default. If you wish to turn off ellipsis you can change the prop to false.</Tip>

### Paragraph

To use the Text component for a paragraph, utilize the element prop with value of `"p"`.
This changes the text wrapper element to `p`, enabling the creation of paragraph-style text without ellipsis by default.
The paragraph will receive default top and bottom margins based on browser settings for `p` elements.
Customize ellipsis behavior using the "ellipsis" prop or override default margins with a custom class name.

### Links

A Text component with a link skin can be used to create a link within running text that redirects to an external webpage, as demonstrated in the following example.

  <Story of={TextStories.LinksInsideRunningText} />
</Canvas>
